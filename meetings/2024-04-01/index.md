## Next meeting prep

Would you like to meet again? When? What kinds of things would you like to focus on?

* Would be nice to going back to discussion about Psychological safety
  around openscapes and open science - how to feel “safe” to share and use materials
  (can be overwhelming)
   * There are a lot of positive interactions in open source communities that
     aren’t very visible. Would making them more visible help?
