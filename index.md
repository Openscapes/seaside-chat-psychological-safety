title: "Seaside chats: Psychological safety"
---

## What is a seaside chat?

The idea is encouraging a community to have a regularly scheduled session for
safe, self-facilitated discussion with a limited agenda.
These discussions often focus on technical, organizational, or interpersonal challenges.
For example, exploring challenges with data visualization, open science, or psychological safety.

The chat would start with a topic, and participants would lead with facilitators playing
a role of ensuring the space is safe and that diverse voices are heard rather than
leading the discussion.


### Structure

* Check-in / icebreaker (word cloud / survey / prompt): 5 minutes
* Discussion on experiences / challenges: 25 minutes
* Discussion on what we can do about it: 25 minutes
* Wrap-up / prep next meeting: 5 minutes


#### Discussion format

* Gather ideas people want to talk about in some shared space, e.g. Google Doc,
  Etherpad, Hedgedoc. Ideally, our tool can also allow voting.
* Anyone can start talking about something
* Use "raise hand" when others are talking to request to speak next
* When discussion slows down, refer to the shared space with ideas to find the next
  topic.


## What is psychological safety?

TODO: Add some reference material, maybe a research paper, about what psychological
safety is. Catherine Hicks might have one that's useful, but I think most of her
research is software development focused.

Psychological safety is the degree to which people feel comfortable speaking about
sensitive subjects without fear of negative consequences.

For example, many of us have experienced traumatic hyper-critical environments
(academia, ...) that have resulted in low levels of psychological safety. Often, we feel
uncomfortable or self-conscious speaking up because we're worried about how people will
respond.

Our goal is to help people become more comfortable sharing their work by discussing
psychological safety, our experiences, and how we can all do better.


## What can we do about it?

Good _and_ bad interactions can be self-reinforcing or contagious. Our actions can
establish virtuous cycles. Let's talk about what we want to see.


## Cadence

TODO: We haven't yet decided on a cadence. Should we meet monthly to provide a long-term
supportive space?
